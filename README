A tool to calculate the relationship between the time to gain a specific amount of clicks on a webpage and the number of different threads you use.

The file names are formatted as following:
[data/makePlot]_numberOfClicks-numberOfThreads[_smooth]

All other files are't noteworthy. (You may consider to take a look at "resources/multiThreadLinker.py" as its really nice, and has a ping-like output!)

To use, only execute timeTester.py (python2.7).

Fancy graphics are located in "graphs/" .
