A tool to calculate the relationship between the time to gain a specific amount of clicks on a webpage and the number of different threads you use.

The file names are formatted as following:
[data/makePlot]_numberOfClicks-numberOfThreads[_smooth]

All other files aren't noteworthy. (You may consider to take a look at "resources/multiThreadLinker.py" as its really nice, and has a ping-like output!)

To use, only execute timeTester.py (python2.7).
If you want to recreate some data, just delete the corresponding "data_X-Y" file. 

Fancy graphics are located in "graphs/" , furthermore they are generated with gnuplot.
